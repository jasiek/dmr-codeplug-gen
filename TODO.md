## Things to fix

- ~~APRS contacts should be generated in BaseRecipe~~
- APRS configuration can be generated in BaseRecipe
- APRS and other messaging talkgroups are country-dependent, so the APRS contact generator needs to take a country into account
- preparing digital contacts can be done in BaseRecipe
- preparing digital channels should use configuration objects for a locality (for example California, USA) and generate channels on that basis. The rest should be done under the hood, maybe in BaseRecipe.
- same for analog channels, can reuse the same configuration object
- zones for digital channels should be generated by repeater and sorted alphabetically (any other sorting order is confusing, including by distance)
- similarly, generating scanlists ought to look at existsing channels and partition them, maybe with the use of some configuration object

## Bugs

- RX Group Lists (lists of contacts/tgs) - too few
- few DMR channels for California
- too few zones
